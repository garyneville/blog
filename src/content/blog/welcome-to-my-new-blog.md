# Welcome to My New Blog!

I'm excited to introduce my new blog, built with a modern stack that gives me the best of both worlds: the simplicity of static sites and the convenience of a content management system.

## The Stack

This blog is powered by:

* **[Astro](https://astro.build)** - A fast, content-focused framework
* **[Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org)** - Git-based CMS for easy content management  
* **[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)** - Lightning-fast hosting at the edge
* **[giscus](https://giscus.app)** - GitHub Discussions-powered comments

## Why This Setup?

I wanted something that felt like WordPress but without the complexity, security concerns, and performance issues. This stack gives me:

### ✅ WordPress-like Experience

* Browser-based editor with Decap CMS
* Media upload and management
* Draft/publish workflow
* Easy content organization

### ✅ Modern Performance

* Static site generated with Astro
* Served from Cloudflare's global edge network
* Automatic optimization and caching
* Lighthouse scores in the 90s+

### ✅ Developer Friendly

* All content lives in Git as Markdown
* TypeScript support throughout
* Modern tooling and hot reload
* Easy to customize and extend

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be sharing:

* **Development insights** - Lessons learned from real projects
* **DevOps practices** - Infrastructure, deployment, and automation tips  
* **Code snippets** - Useful scripts and configurations
* **Photography** - Because code isn't everything!

## Comments Powered by GitHub

Notice the comments section below? That's powered by GitHub Discussions via giscus. It means:

* No extra database or server needed
* Good spam protection  
* Integration with GitHub's ecosystem
* Visitors can comment with their GitHub accounts

Try leaving a comment and let me know what you think!

## Coming Soon

I'm planning to add:

* Search functionality
* RSS feeds
* Dark mode improvements
* More content categories
* Performance metrics dashboard

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something useful here!
